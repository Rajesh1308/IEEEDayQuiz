                IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, was founded through the merger of two prominent organizations: the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). While there isn't a single founder of IEEE, the leaders of these organizations played key roles in its formation.
                The AIEE was established in 1884, and its notable figures included Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, and Elihu Thomson, who were influential in the early development of electrical engineering.
                The IRE, founded in 1912, had its own distinguished leaders, including Guglielmo Marconi, Lee De Forest, and Edwin Armstrong, who were pioneers in radio and electronic engineering.
                The merger of these two organizations in 1963 created IEEE, the world's largest professional association for technology and engineering, with a mission to advance innovation and technological progress across a wide range of fields.
